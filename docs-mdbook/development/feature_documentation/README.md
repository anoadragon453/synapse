# Feature Documentation

This section covers implementation documentation for various features of Synapse.

If a developer is planning to make a change to a feature of Synapse, it can be useful for
general documentation of how that feature is implemented to be available. This saves the
developer time in place of needing to understand how the feature works by reading the
code.

Documentation that would be more useful for the perspective of a sysadmin, rather than
a developer who's intended to change to code, should instead be placed in
[Usage](../../usage/).
